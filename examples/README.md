luminateExtend.js - Examples
============================

Together, the examples provided here represent a very basic sample website for the fictitious organization American Health Society. 
Two versions of the examples are available for your perusal &mdash; one built with 
[Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/convio/luminateExtend/tree/master/examples/bootstrap/), and one with 
[Foundation 4](https://github.com/convio/luminateExtend/tree/master/examples/foundation/).
